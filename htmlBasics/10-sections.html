    <h1>Section 1</h1>
    <p>Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

        This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.
        
        Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Take your time. Speed will come later. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.</p>
